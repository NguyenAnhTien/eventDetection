# Event Detection Demonstration [here](eventDetection/Readme.pdf )

- Using deepleaning technique for real-time event detection
  - CNN: identify informative data
  - LSTM: temporal event detetection (earthquake data is used for demo)
- Introduction
We  designed  a  Graphic  User  Interface  usingPyQt. Both CNN  model and LSTM  model arebuilt in Python using Keras deep learning library.Because the deep models can take a long time totrain,  we  should  pre-train  them  for  saving  andthen  load  them  again  for  use.  We  can  use  tabtraining  CNN  or  RNN  to  retrain  them.  Thefollowing interfaces are tabs for setting and somemodes of our application.Fig. 5 â€“aconfigurationtab for keywords, set the language for streamingtweets,  set  name,  and  some  other  information.Fig.  5-bis  for  display  list  of  the  informativetweet  and  other  is  the  list  of  non-informative tweet coming with information about time. Thelast   sub-figure   is   real-time   plotting   ofaccumulated frequency keyword-related tweets,predicted  values,  and  earthquake  candidateunderlying time series data.

# eventDetection
Using deepleaning technique for real-time event detection
CNN: identify informative data
LSTM: temporal event detetection (earthquake data is used for demo)

Step1: clone this sourcecode to your local repository
-git clone https://github.com/quanap5/eventDetection

Step2: Download word-embeddings for CNN model
-Download from website: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
-This configure for embedding with 200 of dimensionality namelly: glove_twitter_27B_200d.text
-Add to folder /embedings/

Step 3 Run with GUI
-python demo.try
